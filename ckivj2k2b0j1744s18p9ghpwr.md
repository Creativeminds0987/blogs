## What is Firebase??

# Firebase?
- It is a `Backend-as-a-Service` (BaaS) for `mobile` (ios and android) and `web application` development platform.
- It provides users with hosted backend services such as a `real-time database`, `cloud storage`, `authentication`, `crash reporting`, `remote configuration`, and `hosting for static files`, `etc`.

_______________________

## Developer?
- developed by `Firebase Inc` in `2011`.
- then acquired by `Google` in `2014`.

#### Realtime Database
Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in Realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

#### Authentication
Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

#### Storage
`Firebase` storage feature is powered by `Google Cloud Storage` and allows users to easily `download media files` and `visual contents`. Which is also helpful in making use of user-generated content.

#### Cloud functions
Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

#### Hosting
The hosting feature of Firebase allows developers to update their contents in the Content Delivery Network (CDN) during production. Firebase offers full hosting support with a custom domain, Global CDN, and an automatically provided SSL Certificate.

#### Cloud Firestore
Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.
